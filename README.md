# Maze Runner

## Technologies Used

- React.js

## Summary of Project
- Project to create a clear and simple visualization application using React.js to find the shortest path between any two points on a grid with a maze using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

- Implemented a feature whereby users are able to create obstacles/draw mazes by dragging their mouse over the grid.

## Future Work

- Add maze generation algorithms.
- Add more path-finding algorithms.
